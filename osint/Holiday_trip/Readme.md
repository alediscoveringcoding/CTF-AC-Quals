## Description

>My brother went to the beach last week. He knows I collect novelty mugs so he picked one up for me - but, as always, he couldn’t resist turning it into a challenge.

>So he sent me a photo saying, “Picked one up for you and left it at the our parents house. Father will keep it hidden until you can tell him where I bought it.”

>Your mission: help me find the beach where my brother bought the mug in order to get it from my father.

>Flag format: CTF{the_name_of_the_beach} (case insensitive and ascii characters only in either english,romanian or the native country's language )

## Solve

I started by analyzing the image that was given in the challenge. While looking at it, I remembered some memes I had seen online about beaches in Bulgaria. That gave me the idea that the picture might actually come from there. To verify this, I performed a reverse image search. The search confirmed my suspicion and showed that the photo was taken at the beach in the "Nisipurile de Aur" resort.
